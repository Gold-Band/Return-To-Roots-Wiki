# Usage
The website is hosted [here](https://gold-band.github.io/Return-To-Roots-Wiki/). It is **automatically**
hosted through GitHub Pages, so all you need to do is push to `master` and GitHub Actions will deploy directly from the `master` branch!

# Contributing
To make working on the wiki as accessible as possible, it's being powered by [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/). 
Please read the documentation. 
If you're confused, you can always look directly at how they do it on their [GitHub](https://github.com/vuejs/vitepress) page
